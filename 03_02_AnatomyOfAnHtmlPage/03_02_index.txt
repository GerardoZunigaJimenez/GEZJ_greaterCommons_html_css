An HTML document is made up of a document type declaration (DTD) and different tags.
The DTD is declared at the top of the page: <!DOCTYPE html> â€¦.
The different elements required for a basic HTML document: html, head, meta, title, body.
We use MDN as our source for documentation to learn about the different elements.
